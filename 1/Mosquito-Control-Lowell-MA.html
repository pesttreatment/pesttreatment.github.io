Farming takes on the concern with incorporated pest management. The term pest" refers to more than one reason for issues including illness, unwanted insects, mites, nematodes, mollusks and weeds. A variety of treatment approaches have been used, including chemical techniques, such as pesticide applications and harmful gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or warming the materials, the use of micro-waves, gamma radiation, customized environments, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to keep an eye on for pests and determine them accurately, so that suitable control choices can be made in conjunction with action thresholds.
