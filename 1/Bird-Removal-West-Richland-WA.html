Employers typically offer pest controller training programs covering pesticide application and key elements of the task like handling rodents and termites.</p>
<p>Termites are such devastating pests that you want your termite treatment to lead to termite extermination. When action, monitoring, and identification thresholds suggest that pest control is needed, and preventive approaches are no longer efficient or offered, IPM programs then assess the correct control technique both for efficiency and threat.
