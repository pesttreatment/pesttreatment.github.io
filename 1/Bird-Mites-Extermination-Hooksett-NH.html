<p>Pest management needs a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied only after regular monitoring shows that a pest population had reached a financial limit level. Numerous individual product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to specify what IPM suggests for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in minimal areas.</p>
<p>IPM is utilized in agriculture, cultivation, forestry, human habitations, preventive conservation and general pest control, consisting of structural pest management, turf pest management and decorative pest management. Treat a pest invasion with a hand sprayer, fertilize your lawn with a granular spreader, deal with termite treatments with a foamer, bait for roaches and ants with a professional bait gun, or use pre-emergent herbicides with a knapsack sprayer.</p>
