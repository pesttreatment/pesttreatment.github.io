<p>By establishing a personalized Integrated Pest Management program for your garden, you can do something about it-- with the ideal controls-- when pests appear, and then rest simple. Factor to consider of crop plants as active components of multitrophic level interactions is important to an overall systems approach to pest management. Commercial pest control companies have obligations that go far beyond that of handling and getting rid of pests.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and dissuade pest determination consist of intercropping (several crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>Pesticides are selected and used in a manner that decreases their possible damage to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is most likely to be misinterpreted as pest management without chemicals which in truth need based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the components or product packaging, and the facility itself will bring in pests through food odours and lighting.</p>
