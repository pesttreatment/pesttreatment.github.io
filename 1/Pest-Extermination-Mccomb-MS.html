<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, appropriate irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the community as an entire and considers a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most effective and least damaging strategy.</p>
<p>Constant security and tracking of insect pests population is essential for evaluation of damage and for figuring out the requirements for actions to be taken. Chemical pest control is the use of pesticides to ruin harmful insects ororganisms. Current concern for pollinator health has actually also resulted in constraints on using certain pesticides.
