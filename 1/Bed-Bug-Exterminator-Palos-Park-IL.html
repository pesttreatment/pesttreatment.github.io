SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, might trigger major damage to structures, office furnishings, specimens and artifacts. Applicators carry out more intricate jobs, are able to use a wider series of pesticides, and may focus on a specific location of pest control.</p>
