<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in a natural system are as harmful to people and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control experts can only do so much to safeguard the food supply," states Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The reality is, food business operators have to take an active role in incorporated pest management by working closely with the professionals.</p>
<p>We traditionally have offered nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the effectiveness of ecologically unsound techniques along with its range of inherent strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, pressures of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the probability that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>Secondly, the best pest control brand names won't leave a single bed bug behind.
