<p>4 ). With its success in numerous parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a environmentally benign and cost-effective  pest control technique ideally fit for both little and big farmers all over the world. Once termites have gone into a building, they do not limit themselves to wood; they likewise damage paper, fabric, carpets and more.
