<h3>Insect Removal Hazard Kentucky</h2>

Numerous of the resources noted at the end of this leaflet can be utilized for recognition of insect pests affecting collections.</p>
<p>Think about alternative approaches (other than pesticides) to make your house and garden unsightly to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from ending up being a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can withstand pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a structure. Current missions for effective, safe, and lasting pest management programs have been targeted mostly toward advancement of new and much better items with which to replace conventional toxic pesticides.</p>

Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular monitoring suggested that a pest population had actually reached a level (the financial limit) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would go beyond the cost of the control procedures.</p>
