<p>The full expression "Integrated Pest Management" (IPM) appeared in press, for the first time, 28 years ago (Kogan 1998). It needs an expert method and strategic attack, which is precisely what you'll get when you employ assistance from Pest Control Services, Inc For example, by consisting of natural opponents as biological control agents in the management of pests, IPM practitioners knew that more specific and less damaging chemicals would need to be used over the long run (Hoy, 1990; Hull et al., 1997).</p>
