Agriculture takes on the concern with incorporated pest management. The term pest" describes more than one reason for problems including diseases, undesirable insects, mites, mollusks, nematodes and weeds. A number of treatment methods have been utilized, consisting of chemical techniques, such as pesticide applications and poisonous gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating up the products, using micro-waves, gamma radiation, customized atmospheres, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
