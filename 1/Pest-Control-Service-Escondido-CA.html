<p>Under this scheme, insect control was "monitored" by qualified entomologists and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from regular monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations. We can deal with a large variety of pests discovered in Texas, consisting of spiders, ants, termites, fleas, ticks, roaches, bed bugs, rodents and other intruders. Sprays, are best utilized against flying pests and biting pests, such as fleas Most insects will die within minutes of entering into contact with an insecticide spray, but some persistent bugs might make you spray the location numerous times prior to giving up.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was thus synonymous with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be used just after routine tracking indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the economic limit) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would surpass the cost of the control measures.</p>
