<p>Our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) method is based on our 4 concepts that together we call ERDM. We understand that finding pests in your home or business is traumatic. Flexibility and Time- The process of pest control takes some time and efforts. Pests are unwanted plants, animals, insects, germs or other organisms that hinder human activity.</p>
<p>It might be TERMITES eating down your wood facilities and consuming your hard-earned cash and expensive assets It might be Cockroaches Roaming Inside your Kitchen and sharing your house as their house OR Mosquitoes, Ants, Silverfish, Spiders, Rodents, Lizards which is bothering your comfort and developing unclean living conditions for you at your houses and work environments.</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly attain levels at which damage is triggered thus becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare).
