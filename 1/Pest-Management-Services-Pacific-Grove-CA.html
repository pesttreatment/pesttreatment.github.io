<h3>Pest Control Management Pacific Grove CA 93950</h3>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, proper watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the environment as a whole and considers a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control methods to produce the most reliable and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and prevent pest perseverance include intercropping (numerous crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with choose application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be very effective in causing considerable decreases in pest populations in certain situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially available natural opponents or saving natural opponent populations by supplying refuges or avoiding practices that damage them are a few of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production uses many of the exact same principles as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to decrease the requirement for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
