IPM is the choice and use of pest control actions that will guarantee favourable economic condition, social and ecological consequences 13 and is applicable to many agricultural, public health and feature pest management situations.</p>
<p>IPM is utilized in farming, cultivation, forestry, human habitations, preventive conservation and basic pest control, including structural pest management, turf pest management and ornamental pest management.
