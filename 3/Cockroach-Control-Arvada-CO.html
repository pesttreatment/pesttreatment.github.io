<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and a few of the pesticides used in an organic system are as harmful to people and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control specialists can only do so much to safeguard the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The truth is, food business operators have to take an active role in integrated pest management by working closely with the experts.</p>
<p>The decision of the appropriate reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides harmful to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively affect natural enemies than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect species or life phases.</p>
<p>Pesticides are selected and applied in a manner that lessens their possible damage to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is more than likely to be misunderstood as pest management without chemicals which in fact need based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the components or product packaging, and the facility itself will draw in pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
