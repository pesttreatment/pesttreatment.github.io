<p>The advantages of Integrated Pest Management are enormous directly to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control includes using living organisms to control a pest population. Do not blend pesticides. There are 4 major components in the brand-new IPM model that address different pest management options, the understanding, and resources the grower has to attend to the pest concern, preparation and company of information to take appropriate management actions, and preserving great interaction to distribute and acquire understanding about pests and their management.</p>
