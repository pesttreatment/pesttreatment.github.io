IPM involves utilizing the very best combination of cultural, chemical and biological procedures for particular circumstances, including plant biotechnology as proper. This preparation includes attention to field histories to expect what the pest problems may be, picking crop ranges which are resistant or tolerant to pest damage, picking tillage systems that will suppress awaited pest damage while providing the crop the greatest yield potential.</p>
