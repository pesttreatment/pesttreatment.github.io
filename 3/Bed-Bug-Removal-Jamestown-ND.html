<p>Thank you for choosing RID Pest Control to secure your house from termites. Saved product pests are more than likely to be in a food component on shipment to a processing factory or a processed food product when kept for a long period of time. Using pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a regular basis, regardless of requirement, is not IPM. The dependence on pesticides as a sole technique of control has led to the development of insect resistance and unfavorable effects on human health, natural opponents, and the environment.</p>
<p>As part of the Sustainable Usage Directive on Pesticides, expert users of pesticides are required to think about the principles of IPM before the use of chemicals. Biological pest control is an approach of managing pests such as insects and termites by using other organisms 8 It counts on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural systems, but normally also includes an active human management function.</p>
