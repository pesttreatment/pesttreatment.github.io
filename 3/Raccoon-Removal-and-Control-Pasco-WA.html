<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal does of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience retarded development and feeding and go through higher parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). Simply put, an effective, nondisruptive method to manage a moderate beet armyworm break out may be to retard its development and damage while providing the parasitoids time to work, consequently enhancing the parasitoids' result throughout subsequent generations.</p>
