<p>The approach to be selected for IPM depends on many aspects, the important of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and economic element of the management. Insect pests trigger significant losses to food and fiber crops worldwide.

For instance, a wealthy community likely will have a lot of large, pricey houses, so pest control costs might be higher there since there's more area for a pest control company to cover in one of those homes.</p>
