Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simple meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about decreasing pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management tactics are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent economic loss is warranted.</p>
<p>A redirection of pest management is needed to incorporate year-round soil, weed, cropping, water, and associated practices at farm and community levels and to think about the impacts of these practices on the total animals, dietary state, and balance of regional ecosystems (16 ). Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term used to explain an organized approach of managing pests utilizing non-chemical pest management techniques and the judicious usage of pesticides when pest populations exceed acceptable levels.</p>
