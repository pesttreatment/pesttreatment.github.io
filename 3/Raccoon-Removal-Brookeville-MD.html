<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, appropriate irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the community as a whole and takes into account a balanced mix of the abovementioned control techniques to produce the most efficient and least destructive plan.</p>
