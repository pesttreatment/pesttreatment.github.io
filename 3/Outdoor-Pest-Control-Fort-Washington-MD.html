<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is deemed a ecologically benign and economical  pest control strategy ideally matched for both little and large farmers worldwide. When termites have gotten in a building, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making procedure in which observations (from inspection and monitoring) are used to make pest control decisions based on pre-determined management goals.</p>
<p>Termites eat furniture, documents, books, and even files kept in lockers and safes, thus triggering gigantic damage within just a few months. This stops the pest acquiring resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or used to the crops. Exterminators go to client houses and services to check for insects or rodents. Classical biological control involves presenting natural enemies from a pest's native variety into a brand-new area where native natural enemies do not offer control.</p>
<p>Normally, the main objective of IPM programmes is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, originally established for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now established to encompass diseases, weeds, and other pests that might hinder the management goals of sites such as industrial and residential structures, lawn and grass locations, and home and neighborhood gardens.</p>
