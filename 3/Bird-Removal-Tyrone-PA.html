<p>Early detection oftentimes can help address the pest situation by inexpensive spot treatment or removal of pests or infected or infested plant material. Novel tactics such as silencing of pest gene or RNA interference (RNAi) and endosymbionts hosted by insect pests could be utilized as possible brand-new tools for future management of insect pests.</p>
<p>The professional user must keep the use of pesticides and other kinds of intervention to levels that are needed, e.g. by lowered doses, minimized application frequency or partial applications, considering that the level of risk in vegetation is appropriate and they do not increase the threat for development of resistance in populations of harmful organisms.</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly accomplish levels at which damage is triggered thus ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For example, a rich area likely will have a lot of large, costly houses, so pest control expenses might be higher there since there's more area for a pest control company to cover in among those houses.</p>
