When distributed in the field or put in traps, baits including harmful product will draw in and eliminate the pests.</p>
<p>The technique to be chosen for IPM depends on numerous aspects, the crucial of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and economic element of the management. Insect pests cause significant losses to food and fiber crops worldwide.
