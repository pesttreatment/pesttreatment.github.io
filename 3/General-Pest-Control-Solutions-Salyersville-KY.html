<p>In Asia, various phases of IPM have been effectively embraced in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (vegetables, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
<p>The decision of the correct cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides poisonous to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively impact natural enemies than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect types or life stages.</p>
<p>A common mistake most businesses face is describing their business name too literally by using worn-out pest control terms like control, pesticide, insecticide, and management. The pest management market is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and around 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, insects, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, flies and bees are frequently found pests in our society.</p>
<p>Consider alternative techniques (other than pesticides) to make your home and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you act to keep pests from ending up being a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can stand up to pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a structure. Current quests for efficient, safe, and enduring pest management programs have actually been targeted primarily towards advancement of new and much better items with which to change conventional toxic pesticides.</p>
