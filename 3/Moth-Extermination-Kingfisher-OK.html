Crop losses due to illness, arthropods, and weeds, though challenged by some as a legitimate measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the surge of pest control.</p>
<p>Current studies record the need for ongoing decreases in dangerous pesticide usage and practices.
