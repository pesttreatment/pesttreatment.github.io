For that reason, a mere switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural enemies, although valuable in decreasing environmental contamination and security issues, still does not truly deal with the environmentally based weak point of the traditional pest control method.</p>
<p>In reference to the idea of integrating making use of other and biological controls in complementary ways, the term was later on widened to embrace collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been selected either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
