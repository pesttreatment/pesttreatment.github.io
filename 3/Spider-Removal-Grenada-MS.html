<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household pest pests. Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly exclusively about minimizing pesticide usage.

<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can rapidly attain levels at which damage is triggered thus ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare).
