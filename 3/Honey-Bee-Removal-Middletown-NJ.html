<p>When administered by an expert pest control professional, termite treatment works to not only eliminate active infestations but also avoid future ones. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a environmentally sensitive and effective approach to pest management that depends on a combination of sensible practices. IPM is a technique to ensure financial practicality at both customer and producer level (seller is always expected to earn a profit), ecological safety through a well balanced usage of all readily available pest control options, and social acceptability because IPM-based food is safe and budget friendly.</p>
<p>The 2nd employee is an applicator, who utilizes a wide variety of pesticides and may specialize in a specific location of pest control.
