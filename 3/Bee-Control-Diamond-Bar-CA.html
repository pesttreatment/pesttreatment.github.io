The chemical controls are used only after regular monitoring indicates that a pest population had reached an economic threshold level. Numerous private product growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM implies for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are available in limited areas.</p>

<p>Generally, the primary objective of IPM programs is on farming insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, initially developed for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now developed to encompass illness, weeds, and other pests that may interfere with the management objectives of websites such as residential and commercial structures, yard and turf areas, and house and community gardens.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production applies much of the very same concepts as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to lower the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
