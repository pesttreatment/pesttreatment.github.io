<p>The clinical basis of "Integrated Pest Control" developed over a duration of about ten years, generally amongst researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside schools. Crops are typically monocultures, consisting of a single crop species, which produces a homogenous habitat typically lacking key requirements of natural enemies, thus favoring pest types.</p>

IPM means reacting to pest problems with the most efficient, least-risk choice.
