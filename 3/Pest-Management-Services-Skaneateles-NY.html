<p>For some jobs, pest control workers utilize a mix of pest management methods, a practice referred to as incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of regular examinations. Crop losses due to arthropods, illness, and weeds, though disputed by some as a valid step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the augmentation of pest control.</p>
