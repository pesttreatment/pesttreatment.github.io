When the non-chemical tools are not completely capable to keep pest or disease levels listed below the economic threshold, there are often possibilities to utilize chemical pesticides with very little effect on microbial pesticides or natural enemies.</p>
<p>In addition to establishing clear signs that a pest control program is indeed an IPM system, it is also essential to offer requirements to measure performance of the system.
