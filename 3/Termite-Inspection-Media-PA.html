Avoidance of crucial pest problems may be more quickly accomplished if the grower and scout make the effort to recognize, analyze and correct problems before crops are introduced.</p>
<p>There are numerous agricultural practices that make the environment less favorable to insect pests. IPM extended the principle of integrated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to include all methods. This chapter talks about various approaches to keep pest insects at tolerable levels or simply put integrated pest management (IPM). Keep pets and kids far from areas where pesticides have been used.</p>
<p>Also, think about how the variety of plants to be grown in the exact same location might affect ease of pesticide applications and spread of disease. Pest control involves non-lethal techniques too, such as keeping the area totally free and clean of any food debris or other attractants, sealing up entry methods such as cracks in walls or the space in between the bottom of the flooring and a door.</p>
<p>Typically, the primary goal of IPM programs is on farming insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, initially established for agricultural pest management, IPM programs are now developed to encompass diseases, weeds, and other pests that might interfere with the management objectives of sites such as residential and industrial structures, yard and turf areas, and house and neighborhood gardens.</p>
