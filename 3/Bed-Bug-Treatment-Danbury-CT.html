<p>As gone over previously, knowledge about the ecological interrelationships in between insects and their environment is critical to efficient pest management. Recently, the European Union has adopted IPM as a policy for management of insect pests. If outsourced, the food business should realize it has an equivalent role to play in pest control" with the pest management expert, says Dr. Siddiqi.</p>
<p>According to a just recently released report by Fortune Business Insights entitled, Pest Control Market Size, Share & Industry Analysis, By Pest Type (Insects, Termites, Rodents, Others), Technique (Chemical, Mechanical, and Biological), Application (Residential, Commercial, and Industrial), and Regional Projection, 2020 - 2027," the market worth was USD 19.73 billion in 2019 and is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 6.31% during the projection duration, 2020 to 2027.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses much of the same ideas as IPM but restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to lower the need for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
