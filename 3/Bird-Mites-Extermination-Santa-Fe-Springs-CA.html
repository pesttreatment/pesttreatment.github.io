<p>Pest management needs a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied just after regular monitoring suggests that a pest population had reached a financial threshold level. Many specific commodity growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM suggests for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are available in limited areas.</p>
<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical ways to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest efficient dose when other methods of pest control have actually stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that concentrates on long-term avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of strategies such as biological control, environment manipulation, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>The success of control strategies need to be determined using signs based upon monitoring of hazardous organisms, beneficials, pesticide use, and effect on the environment. These include the resurgence of pest populations after decimation of the natural enemies, development of insecticide-resistant populations, and unfavorable impacts on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
<p>A service plan like Economy Exterminators' Total Pest Control program is the only truly efficient method to eliminate pests and prevent them from coming back. To much better control pests while respecting a food plant's sensitive ecological requirements, you need to apply the principles of integrated pest management (IPM).
