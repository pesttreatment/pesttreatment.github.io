To address intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is generally used where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has been successfully used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
