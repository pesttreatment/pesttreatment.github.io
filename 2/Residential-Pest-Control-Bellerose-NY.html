<p>The advantages of Integrated Pest Management are tremendous directly to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control involves using living organisms to control a pest population. Do not blend pesticides. There are four significant components in the new IPM model that attend to different pest management options, the knowledge, and resources the grower has to attend to the pest problem, planning and company of information to take proper management actions, and maintaining great communication to distribute and obtain understanding about pests and their management.</p>
