<p>Damage of crop residue: Pupae of pest stays inside the crop residue and can be controlled by destroying it. IPM is practiced to some degree in all farming crops, however synthetic pesticides stay a dominant tactic in handling pests. Perhaps you're the type to dive in, research your pest, check out the most reliable control choices, and are feeling well prepared to take things on on your own.</p>
<p>Pests that follow a specific seasonal pattern can be controlled by adjusting planting dates.
