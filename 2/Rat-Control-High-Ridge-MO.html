<p>For some tasks, pest control workers utilize a combination of pest management techniques, a practice called incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of an effective IPM program is a schedule of regular assessments. Crop losses due to weeds, diseases, and arthropods, though challenged by some as a valid measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the surge of pest control.</p>
<p>When pest issues are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control measures are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis solutions or its cry toxic substances in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>

Many pesticide problems are caused by a small number of the pesticides offered today.</p>
