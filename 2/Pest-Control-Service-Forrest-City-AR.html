<p>By completing and utilising an IPM strategy, members may be able to conserve cash on pest control methods which were previously utilized and can potentially decrease future problems with pesticide resistance on farm. Since they are normally more efficient and can generally be used to control several pests, the majority of insecticides fall into the chemical category. Physical barriers such as fences, internet, mulch, and tree trunk guards can leave out pests and lower the damage they inflict.</p>
