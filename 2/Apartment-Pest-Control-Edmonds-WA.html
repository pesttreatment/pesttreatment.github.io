<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the best for other organisms and for air, soil, and water quality; use pesticides in bait stations instead of sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds instead of a whole area. Due to any number of factors, consisting of those mentioned in the Chemical and Cultural sections, jeopardizing the efficiency of natural opponents frequently enables prospective pest organisms to experience practically uncontrolled population development and enables them to reach pest status.</p>
<p>Community IPM professionals work to determine and fix pest-friendly conditions, removing access to food, water and harborage by improving sanitation, upkeep, exclusion and landscape management practices.
