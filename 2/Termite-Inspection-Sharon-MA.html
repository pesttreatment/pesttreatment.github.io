<p>National Pesticide Info Center: Provides unbiased, science-based information about pesticides to allow individuals to make educated decisions about pesticides usage. Mix pesticides according to label instructions. Waage (39) recommends that biopesticides might form the methadone of IPM," helping agroecosystems to recuperate from the habit of calendar spraying while we are upgrading and supporting them to a more self-renewing capability.</p>
<p>A few of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, reliable versus sucking pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, efficient against red cotton bug, cutworms, grasshoppers; botanical mixtures, combinations of extracts from different plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, cold, gliricidia, marigold, etc</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was thus synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular monitoring suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the economic limit) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would go beyond the cost of the control procedures.</p>
