<p>Pest management needs a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used just after routine tracking shows that a pest population had reached a financial limit level. Numerous private commodity growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM indicates for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are available in restricted locations.</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived harmful metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical molecules, comparable to synthetic chemicals, and have a number of the environmental and human security risks as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>Pesticides are picked and used in such a way that lessens their possible damage to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is probably to be misconstrued as pest management without chemicals which in reality requirement based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the active ingredients or product packaging, and the facility itself will bring in pests through food odours and lighting.</p>
