A single spotting of any pest in a storage facility during an audit can mean a great deal of damage to the reputation-wise and company-financial. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your possessions with harmful chemicals, destroy the air quality in your house or business, potentially contaminate food and other perishables, and only eliminates pests at the surface area of the problem.</p>
