<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the community as a whole and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most effective and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>These unknown or poorly comprehended prospective dangers argue for extra levels of protection consisting of exposures to multiple pesticides, at home, at school and in the diet plan; exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, industrial substances and individual care items; and the basic problem in associating persistent health problems to any one particular cause.</p>
<p>Pesticides are chosen and applied in a way that decreases their possible harm to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is more than likely to be misunderstood as pest management without chemicals which in reality need based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the active ingredients or product packaging, and the facility itself will attract pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
<p>But what you'll wind up paying for pest control may be lower or higher, depending on what type of pests you're trying to evict and how typically you're getting the service. You might be doing more damage to your plants by killing the bugs than the bugs were doing to your plants.
