SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, might cause severe damage to structures, office furniture, specimens and artifacts. Applicators perform more intricate jobs, have the ability to use a broader range of pesticides, and may specialize in a specific area of pest control.</p>
