<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been advised as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off due to the fact that growers were not all set for such an intercropping plan.

<p>We traditionally have offered nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the efficiency of ecologically unsound techniques along with its variety of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds.
