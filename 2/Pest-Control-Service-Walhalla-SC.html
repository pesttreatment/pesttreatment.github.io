<p>It keeps using pesticide and other interventions to levels that are economically and environmentally warranted and minimises dangers to human health and the environment.

<p>Pest control is an incredibly crucial procedure owing to the fact that a variety of pests are providers of damaging disease-causing microbes. Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the obliteration of a couple of pests by collective efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006).
