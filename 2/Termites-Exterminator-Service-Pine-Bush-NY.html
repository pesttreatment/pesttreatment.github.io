<p>In referral to the principle of integrating making use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later on expanded to welcome coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
