<p>The revival of bed bugs has actually caused more than the scary little blood suckers to come out of the woodwork. We take a look at the big picture and concentrate on long term prevention of pests by carrying out pre-treatment inspections, identifying conditions conducive to pests, de-webbing, placement of monitoring gadgets, sanitation suggestions, avoidance & exemption, and using pesticides in a strategic and safe manner are all examples of how Mills PM implements the practices of IPM.</p>
<p>We traditionally have offered nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the efficiency of ecologically unsound techniques as well as its selection of inherent strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thus increasing the probability that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
