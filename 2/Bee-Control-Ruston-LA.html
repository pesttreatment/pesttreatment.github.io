<p>The Georgia Pest Management Handbook gives existing information on selection, application, and safe usage of pest control chemicals.

It is essential that we establish a more active method that seeks to understand natural enemies and how they work as a part of the community and to promote their efficiency by use of environment management (landscape ecology) and other cultural management approaches.</p>
<p>If, after following scheduled and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply picked biopesticides with low environmental effect. Professional exterminators use various types of pesticides and baits to kill and get rid of pests. Efficient, long-term corrective actions can then be required to prevent pests from entering the structure and infesting the building and collections.</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was thus associated with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be used only after routine monitoring indicated that a pest population had actually reached a level (the financial limit) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would go beyond the expense of the control measures.</p>
