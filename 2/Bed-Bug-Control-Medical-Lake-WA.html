	<meta name="description" content="Insect And Pest Control in Medical Lake WA - The applied material cost of TRFs (in US dollars) ranged from $2.6 to $4.2 per apartment, while gel baits were higher ($11.9 to $16.0, Table 4 ). However, consumers typically cannot purchase TRFs individually, thus a more realistic comparison would be the realized cost (see Table 4 for equation), which ranged from $7.8 to $12.5, while gel baits ranged from $14.0 to $23.4. Time estimates to complete the interventions were 6 h for TRFs and 2 h for gel baits.">
